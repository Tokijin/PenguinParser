PenguinParser
-------------
For use in parsing basketball statistics files created from Afro Penguins games.

Should take an input CSV file with a properly formatted header indicating the game
from which the stats were collected, and each following line with the format:
Timestamp, player name, statistic, result

The CSV will contain every statistical play of the game on a new line. By pulling
together the player involved and the result, the program shall be able to determine
a running tally of all stats on all players of the Afro Penguins team. The timestamps
will also permit the ability to fine tune future queries such that only first half
or second half numbers will be considered, the overall plus/minus of a player can be
calculated, or clutch performances can be captured.

Ideally, there will be a user interface that allows the path to the new CSV file
to be input into the long-term database. That database can then be queried with
game, player, season specifics to display the desired information. There should be
another feature to also create a single game stat sheet given a CSV file. This
will be used after each game to create the weekly recap stat sheet. 

Necessary classes:
